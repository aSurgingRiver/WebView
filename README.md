WebView is an enterprise browser plug-in designed for virtual engine. It uses many advanced technologies. It doesn't drop frames when browsing the web or watching video. The kernel adopts the latest CEF version and optimizes it. It has GPU binding function, supports the separation of game and browser rendering, adds rendering cache inside the plug-in, and the rendering effect is smooth. In terms of communication with web pages, V8 technology is adopted to make the Unreal Engine interact with web pages in real time.
